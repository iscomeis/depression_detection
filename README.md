# **Depression Detection using Deep Learning**

- In today's fast-paced world, mental health issues have become a significant concern, with depression affecting millions of individuals globally. Detecting depression early can significantly improve the outcomes for those affected. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we aim to develop a model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of depression based on various factors.

- This project focuses on building a robust deep learning classification model to predict depression using a dataset containing relevant features. The following steps will guide us through data preparation, model building, and evaluation metrics, ultimately aiming to achieve high accuracy and reliable performance in predicting depression.
